Richard Kidwell's Lab 4

New Controls:
Controlling the light is supposed to be done with the numpad, but I made alternates in case you don't have one.

Numpad5 or up moves the light forward.
Numpad2 or down moves the light backward.
Numpad1 or left moves the light left.
Numpad3 or right moves the light right.
Numpad9 or ' moves the light up.
Numpad6 or / moves the light down.
Numpad7 or ; increases the light's intensity.
Numpad4 or . decreases the light's intensity.

I separated my trees and houses so you can inspect both the tops and bottoms of the primitives.

Old Controls:

My scene can be rotated by left clicking on the canvas and moving the cursor. (I realize the control is still a bit janky but it should suffice to move around the scene)
It can be zoomed by right clicking on the canvas and moving the cursor up and down.
There are camera buttons which can move the camera eye left, right, forward, backwards, up, and down.
There are Center of Interest buttons which can move the center of interest left, right, forward, backwards, up, down, and roll it left or right.
There is a UFO that can be controlled with the keyboard.
You can move the UFO forward with f, backwards with b, left with l, right with r, up with u, and down with d.
You can rotate the UFO left with q and right with a. You can rotate the UFO's gun down with s and up with w, though the gun can only be rotated 90 degrees.

There doesn't appear to be any extra credit on this assignment.

I tested this assignment with Google Chrome on Windows 10.
