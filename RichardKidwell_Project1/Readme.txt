To use my program, you first have to choose a CSV file from your computer.

Then, you may show one of the four graphs by pressing one of the 4 buttons.

My graphs have text set up to be able to match any canvas size, though you would have to change the code to change the size of the canvasses.
My axes are labelled with flower type and scale lines up to the max with lines across to help you gauge the size.
I made a legend for the graph of all flower types.

I tested my code in Google Chrome on a Windows 10 computer.
