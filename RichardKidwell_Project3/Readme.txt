Richard Kidwell's Lab 3

My scene can be rotated by left clicking on the canvas and moving the cursor.
It can be zoomed by right clicking on the canvas and moving the cursor up and down.
There are camera buttons which can move the camera eye left, right, forward, backwards, up, and down.
There are Center of Interest buttons which can move the center of interest left, right, forward, backwards, up, down, and roll it left or right.
There is a UFO that can be controlled with the keyboard.
You can move the UFO forward with f, backwards with b, left with l, right with r, up with u, and down with d.
You can rotate the UFO left with q and right with a. You can rotate the UFO's gun down with s and up with w, though the gun can only be rotated 90 degrees.

This assignment doesn't appear to have any bonus points available, but if it does I can easily add primitives to this scene using very few lines due to how I designed the methods.

I tested this assignment with Google Chrome on Windows 10.
