This is Richard Kidwell's Lab 5 submission

To use this program all you have to do is load in and click and drag to rotate the view of the geodude.
However, this does have to be online, so you can access it from my site at http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~kidwell.53/CSE5542/Project5/Lab5.html

I have heard you might be able to open this locally through Firefox, though I haven't confirmed.
I used Google Chrome to test my code, through the website.
