How to use:
You can select the 6 levels of my object with the 6 buttons.
Circle node one is the root of all the hierarchies. The whole object can be zoomed in with W and out with S.
If you click this button you can rotate the whole object by clicking and moving to the left and right, like in the professor's sample. 
You can move the whole object with F, B, L, and R.
Circles two and three both can be rotated with the mouse and can translate with Q and A once you click the appropriate button. 
Each circle node has 2 circles that extend out from the center, and each circle is connected to the center with a rectangular arm. The arm scales out when you translate the circles.
Each triangle node can be rotated with the mouse, can translate with Q and A, and can be scaled with E and D once you click the appropriate button.
You can reset everything by hitting go back.

Bonus points:
Besides the hierarchies being pretty complicated, I'm not sure I qualify for bonus points. I did decorate a decent amount but not sure that's worth anything.
